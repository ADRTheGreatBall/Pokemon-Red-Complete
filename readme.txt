In this rom hack I made every pokemon available. Instead of putting pokemon where I think they belong, 
What i did was place all the version exclusive pokemon where they originally are in Pokemon Blue. This
 in my opinion creates a version of Gen 1 Pokemon that would have been created had Gamefreak not been 
so greedy to create a game that can only be completed 100%  if I have multiple Versions., This is the 
first of my "Complete" series. I plan to make a complete version for every generation. IDK about anyone 
else but as an autistic man it's incomprehensible that a game has to be repurchased and completed as 
many times as Gamefreak would have you just to get 100% of every Pokemon. Subscribe to my
